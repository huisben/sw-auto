# Southwest auto 24 hour

A-List all day!

I have a few ideas how to implement:

we could set up an inbox that accepts people's "Get ready to fly!" email and just processes it

or people could copy in their "Check In" link which has all the data encrypted (but would have to tell us when the flight is)

or could just fill in name and record and our app will search
